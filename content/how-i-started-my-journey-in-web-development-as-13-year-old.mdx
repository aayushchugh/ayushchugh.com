Hey there! I am Ayush Chugh, a full-stack web developer from India. This all goes back to 2020 when the whole world was under lockdown. I was enjoying it because I didn’t need to go to school. Who doesn’t love vacations, right? Then I thought, “Ayush, why waste time? Let’s do something productive.” That’s when I decided to start learning how to code and make the most of my time.

The first programming language I picked was C, but after writing some code, I realized it wasn’t for me. So, I left it and went back to playing games for a couple of days. A few days later, my brother was making a website for his college project and he asked me how it looked. I recommended some changes, and as he opened VSCode, I was attracted to its theme. I thought, “This thing looks cool. Let’s give it a try.”

So, I asked him to teach me, and he shared some YouTube videos with me. I started learning HTML and was highly satisfied and motivated by the actual output of the HTML code. I realized I could create my own websites, so I kept learning. I spent around a week learning HTML and CSS.

After that, I did some research on what to learn next and what was in demand in the market. I wanted to know which languages and technologies had a promising future. I decided to learn JavaScript and Git. Following that, I learned SCSS. In February 2021, I built my first live project, [a2infinite](https://a2infinite.com), using HTML, CSS, and SCSS. I completed this project in May 2021.

Next, I wanted to learn how logic is handled on servers, so I did some research and discovered that I could use JavaScript in the backend too. This led me to learn Node.js and MongoDB. After that, I learned about single-page applications and decided to learn ReactJS. I built another live project using the MERN stack and TypeScript.

So, this is the sequence in which I learned web development:

1. HTML/CSS
1. JavaScript
1. Git
1. SCSS
1. Node.js
1. MongoDB
1. React
1. TypeScript
