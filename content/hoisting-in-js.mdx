What would you expect the output of the following code to be?

```javascript
a = 2;

var a;

console.log(a);
```

Many developers would expect the output to be `undefined`, since the var a statement comes after the `a = 2`, and it would seem
natural to assume that the variable is redefined, and thus assigned the default `undefined`. However, the output is actually `2`.

Consider another piece of code:

```javascript
console.log(a);

var a = 2;
```

You might be tempted to assume that, since the previous snippet exhibited some less-than-top-down looking behavior, perhaps in this snippet, 2 will also be printed. Others may think that since the a variable is used before it is declared, this must result in a `ReferenceError`.

Unfortunately, the output is `undefined`, which can be quite confusing.

## What is actually happening?

The best way to think about things is that all declarations, both variables and functions, are processed first, before any part of your code is executed.

When you see `var a = 2;` you probably think of that as one statement. But JavaScript actually interprets it as two separate statements: `var a;` and `a = 2;`. The first statement declares the variable `a`, and the second statement assigns the value `2` to it.

Our first snippet is equivalent to:

```javascript
var a;
a = 2;
console.log(a);
```

The second snippet is equivalent to:

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a);
a = 2;
```

## Functions and Hoisting

Functions are also hoisted in JavaScript. Consider the following code:

```javascript
console.log(foo());
function foo() {
	return 2;
}
```

In this case, the output will be `2`, even though the function `foo` is called before it is defined in the code. This is because function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope, just like variable declarations.

## Function Expressions and Hoisting

However, function expressions behave differently. Consider this code:

```javascript
console.log(foo());
var foo = function () {
	return 2;
};
```

In this case, the output will be `TypeError: foo is not a function`. This happens because the variable `foo` is hoisted, but its assignment as a function happens after the `console.log(foo())` line. So when the code tries to call `foo`, it finds that `foo` is `undefined`, leading to the error.

## Summary

Hoisting in JavaScript can be a source of confusion, especially for those new to the language. The key points to remember are:

- Variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope.
- Variable assignments are not hoisted, meaning they are executed in the order they appear in the code.
- Function declarations are hoisted, allowing them to be called before they are defined.
- Function expressions are not hoisted in the same way, leading to potential errors if called before their assignment.

Understanding hoisting is crucial for writing predictable and bug-free JavaScript code. Always be mindful of where and how you declare your variables and functions to avoid unexpected behavior.
